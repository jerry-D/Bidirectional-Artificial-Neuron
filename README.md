# Bidirectional Artificial Neuron for Conscious Machines
## OpenSCAD 3D model of the world's first Bidirectional Artificial Neuron for conscious machines built from carbon nanotubes, nanotorus, and human ssDNA.

(June 7, 2025)  United States Patent No. US12,324,295B, entitled "COMPLEX NANOSTRUCTURE FORMING A BIDIRECTIONAL NANOSTRUCTURE  MULTIPLEXER OR ARTIFICIAL NEURON" issued on June 3, 2025.  It is the world's first bidirectional artificial neuron "free energy" device for conscious machines.  The artificial neuron is build from carbon nanotubes, carbon nanotorus, and a segment of human ssDNA.  The now patented invention is the first in a series of several fundamental building blocks at the nano scale for use in future conscious machines.

For the purposes of this post, a conscious entity is defined as anything that is responsive to, and capable of, not only accessing, but also using, information from the vacuum state, also sometimes referred to as the zero point.  Albeit clastic, such information includes, among other things, human thoughts and volition, especially those originating from the donor of the ssDNA used for decorating the carbon nanotori or carbon nanotubes used in construction of these patented and patent pending nanostructures used for creating artificial neural networks.  Volition initiated, these nanostructure artificial neural networks tend to attract, condense, and coalesce "like" clastic information.

(November 11, 2024) Publication of Open Letter dated April 19, 2024, addressed to various U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Laboratories, major Universities, and industry leaders.  <!-- The thrust of the letter was to bring attention to a new science involving infinite vacuum state information that can be found available and accessible in spaces comprising the tiniest bit of nothing, also sometimes referred to as the zero point, propounding that our government, educators, and industry leaders need to get busy and form a consortium, work together and take the world lead in this new science, or forever be left behind by foreign competitors.

In the "OpenSCAD_STL" folder of this repository, you will find the "neuron_2.scad" program that you can use to render a 3D model of the Bidirectional Artificial Neuron.  Within the same folder are various pre-rendered .STL files of armchair and zig-zag carbon nanotube segments used to construct the dendrites, axon, and nanotorus aspects of the neuron model.  

The code allows substitution of much simpler "model" CNTs and nanotorus built from solid cylinder segments, which render much, much faster.  This method is suggested if you are just starting out.  Once you become familiar with the code, then you can substitute the use of much more realistic armchair and zig-zag CNT models provided in the source code and .STL files provided in the repository within that folder.  For those of you just starting out with OpenSCAD, the first step would be to go to the OpenSCAD website to download and install the OpenSCAD software for your platform at the following link.

The following are some thumbs of renderings done using the more realistic .STL armchair and zig-zag CNT segments.  To see larger versions of them, simply click on the corresponding thumb.  Note that the images were desaturated to B/W using an external tool to make them look even more realistic.

The following images were rendered using Blender.  To do that, each component comprising the OpenSCAD model was rendered and exported out of OpenSCAD separately in .STL format.  Then each .STL component was imported into Blender.  Starting out, your best bet is to work with the "model" solid components first, then when you have your desired camera angles, etc., set up, then substitute the more realistic armchair and zig-zag components for final render.  Otherwise, it will take forever due to detail and complexity.  These files are rather large and can take a few seconds to load.

Finally, to get grip on the basic physics of how this new science actually works, click on the thumb below to download and read short paper published by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory in November 2017, entitled, "Visualization of Higher Genus Carbon Nanomaterials:  Free Energy, Persistent Current, and Entanglement Entropy". You probably won't understand most of it, but I think you will at least get the gist of it.

A 56-minute "sizzle-reel" video showing remote viewers describing various aspects of the invention can be viewed on YouTube at the following link.  The video comprises (4) 12-15 minute segments from (4) different remote viewing sessions lasting roughtly 1.5 hrs each.  For those unfamiliar with the "military-style" CRV protocol and terminology, a copy of the declassified CRV training manual ("1985_CRV_Beyond.pdf") is included in this repository for your reference.
