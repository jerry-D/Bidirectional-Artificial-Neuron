# Bidirectional Artificial Neuron for Conscious Machines
OpenSCAD 3D model of the world's first Bidirectional Artificial Neuron for conscious machines built from carbon nanotubes, nanotorus, and human ssDNA.

In the "OpenSCAD_STL" folder of this repository, you will find the "neuron_2.scad" program that you can use to render a 3D model of the Bidirectional Artificial Neuron.  Within the same folder are various pre-rendered .STL files of armchair and zig-zag carbon nanotube segments used to construct the dendrites, axon, and nanotorus aspects of the neuron model.  

The code allows substitution of much simpler "model" CNTs and nanotorus built from solid cylinder segments, which render much, much faster.  This method is suggested if you are just starting out.  Once you become familiar with the code, then you can substitute use of much more realistic armchair and zig-zag CNT models provided in the source code and .STL files provided in the repository within that folder.

The following are some thumbs of renderings done using the more realistic .STL armchair and zig-zag CNT segments.  To see larger versions of them, simply click on the corresponding thumb.
